# Speech-Based-Summarization-and-Sentiment-Analysis
Public speaking skills help you communicate important messages inside and outside of the organization. Public speaking is so important that it could be the deciding factor in many things such as your career development, your business growth and even in the relationships you have with your friends and family. We plan to build a tool based on analysis of the recorded speech that can help an individual improve by classifying the feedback of his speech. This is done by highlighting the key points mentioned in the speech and analyzing the over-all sentiment. This problem is interesting because it helps the person to improvise the content and the sentiment associated with it.
